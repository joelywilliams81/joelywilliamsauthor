<h1>📝 Selected Poems</h1>

<h2>Inventory</h2>
<pre>
Some things I’ve wrapped in bubble,
Boxed and marked Handle With Care—
Like the letter my brother mailed me
The week he almost died.
It still smells of cinnamon and mold.
...
Even forgetting
has fees.
</pre>

<h2>The Brief Theater of Passing Cars</h2>
<pre>
We drive past one another—
strangers,
each holding a scene
just long enough to dissolve it.
...
in sips.
</pre>

<h2>The Journals I Never Got to Keep</h2>
<pre>
One was pink with gold locks—
confiscated by a cousin
who laughed too loud at my poems.
...
I grieve them like people.
</pre>

<h2>After the Crash in the Hudson</h2>
<pre>
What floats up is never just wreckage.
It is tariff and treaty,
torn passport and waterlogged hope.
...
What sinks
is always someone else.
</pre>

<h2>Tea Like an Embrace</h2>
<pre>
Boil.
Pour.
Steep.

A steeped quiet—
the kind that only follows weeping,
when steam begins where words won’t go,
and the cup becomes a palm to hold you—
a mercy.
...
Even in Styrofoam…
         it feels holy.
</pre>
