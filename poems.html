        <p>
          A selection of pieces that hold memory, ritual, and everyday holiness. Take
          your time and linger inside the language.

          <h2>Inventory</h2>
          <pre class="poem-text">Some things I’ve wrapped in bubble,

Boxed and marked Handle With Care-
Like the letter my brother mailed me
The week he almost died.
It still smells of cinnamon and mold.

There is a unit inside me
Lined with small keys-
Each one unlocking
a different version of grief.
Rent is due the first of the month.
No refunds.

Sometimes, a memory slips from the shelf-
The pink raincoat,
the music box that played Chopin
until it was silenced
by a spilled glass of wine
and a hand I never trusted.

The air here hums with forgetting.
All climate-controlled,
yet every box has sweat beneath its lid.
Even the wedding dress
folded beside the eviction notice.

A man once broke in.
He took the shoebox of poetry.
Left the tax returns.

I am the unpaid intern
of my own containment.
Every corridor echoes with names
I do not speak aloud.

Like the vase I stole from a gas station.
Like the time I locked away
the softest parts of myself
because love wanted a cleaner floor plan.

Even the spiders keep records here.
They tally each time I return
To peek into bin B12-
The one labeled childhood,
sealed with duct tape
and lavender oil.

But here I am again-
Clipboard in hand,
checking off what I’ve managed to misplace:
The voice I used in fifth grade.
The scent of wet sidewalk chalk.
A night light shaped like a moon.

Even storage has weight.
Even forgetting
has fees.</pre>

          <h2>The Brief Theater of Passing Cars</h2>
          <pre class="poem-text">We drive past one another-
strangers,
each holding a scene
just long enough to dissolve it.

A man in a red uniform shirt
staring into a traffic light
as if waiting for an answer.
Someone has written "I Love You"
on her fogged-up rear window.

The man in the Civic sings off-key
with his whole chest-
no one listening,
but maybe that’s the point.

There are children arguing in the back seat
of a blue minivan.
A mother taps the wheel in time
to something playing quietly on NPR.

I pass a man chewing his lip.
His hands white-knuckled on the wheel.
In the passenger seat,
a bouquet of wilted flowers.

A station wagon rolls by with windows down,
and in it,
a breeze of curry,
two laughing teens,
and an old dog riding shotgun
like a prince.

We never meet again.
We are a gallery of glimpses,
slices of almost-life.
I find God here sometimes-
in the gum wrappers,
the dashboard rosaries,
the sticker that says, Still Here.</pre>

          <h2>The Journals I Never Got to Keep</h2>
          <pre class="poem-text">One was pink with gold locks-
confiscated by a cousin
who laughed too loud at my poems.

Another left open
on the counter like a confession.
Mom read the word touch
and called me impure.

There was one with pressed flowers
that soaked through the pages
like wounds.
My brother handed it over.
I was grounded for a month
and lost something deeper.

In my twenties,
heartsick and couchbound,
I left three at an ex’s house.
He kept them like trophies.

The last ones disappeared
with my mother’s trash bags.
She said, They were clutter.

But they were the voices
of every version of me.
The boy who I first kissed in secret.
The teen who wrote prayers.
The woman who learned to scream
onto paper.

I grieve them like people.</pre>

          <h2>After the Crash in the Hudson</h2>
          <pre class="poem-text">What floats up is never just wreckage.
It is tariff and treaty,
torn passport and waterlogged hope.

A helicopter falls
like a policy no one read.
The papers call it a tragedy.
We know it as Tuesday.

Somewhere a family
waits for a call from ICE.
Somewhere a mother nurses her child
on the edge of a detention cell.

The stock market dips.
The President tweets.
And my neighbor
can’t afford her insulin.

There are whole cities
drowning in legislation.

We build walls,
but not bridges.
Float promises
on waves of silence.
What sinks
is always someone else.</pre>

        <article class="poem-card">
          <h2>Tea Like an Embrace</h2>
          <pre class="poem-text">Boil.
Pour.
Steep.

A steeped quiet-
the kind that only follows weeping,
when steam begins where words won’t go,
and the cup becomes a palm to hold you-
a mercy.

I grew up watching my grandmother
lift her storms in porcelain-
each sip, a spell for survival.
She’d stir silence with honey,
press her lips to the rim like confession.

Tea was offered when no one could apologize.
After slammed doors,
after the hush of bruises too fresh for names.
When our bodies sat beside each other,
unable to look-
Tea filled the space between us
like a warm, unspoken truce.

I learned to brew comfort
at ten, maybe younger,
heating water in a chipped kettle
while my mother paced with the phone to her ear,
whispering grief she couldn’t explain.
I’d slip a bag into her favorite mug-
the one with the faded cardinal-
and wait for her hands to remember mine.

Even now,
I measure my peace in teaspoons.
Chamomile for surrender,
mint for migraines and regret,
ginger when rage simmers too long.
I sit with it at dawn,
before children stir or emails demand
that I become other people.

My mug is wide,
a second heart.
I fill it with the ache of yesterday
and drink slowly,
like one does when they want time to forgive them.

No one taught me this, not really.
But my body knew.
Somewhere between
the quiet kitchen tiles and the rising swirl of scent-
my body remembered warmth
is its own language.

Sometimes, I don't want to talk.
I want tea-
to cradle me like I am still someone's child,
like I am worth the steeping.

Tea does not ask.
Tea does not judge.
It gathers my parts
into warmth.
Lets me dissolve the day
in sips.

Even in Styrofoam…
it feels holy.</pre>
