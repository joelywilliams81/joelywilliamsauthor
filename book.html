              This debut workbook from Joely Williams weaves together prompts rooted
              in writing, visual art, and somatic grounding. Whether you&apos;re moving
              through grief, rebuilding after change, or guiding a community circle,
              the pages offer a steady rhythm for processing what&apos;s arriving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each chapter includes reflective questions, practical exercises, and
              space to witness your own language. Readers have used the workbook in
              classrooms, therapy practices, and family gatherings, creating brave
              space to metabolize both pain and possibility.
