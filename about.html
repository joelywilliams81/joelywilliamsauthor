        <p>
          Bronx-born, Columbia-based, and forever rooted in story, Joely Williams is
          a writer, poet, and community builder whose work creates room for honest
          reflection and collective care.

            <p>
              Joely&apos;s writing practice is steeped in lived experience, ancestral
              lineage, and the rhythms of Black life in America. Her debut workbook,
              <em>Put the Phone Down, We Have a Job to Do</em>, invites readers into a
              layered healing journey that blends ritual, creative prompts, and
              story-driven reflections.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond the page, Joely curates gatherings, workshops, and conversations
              that center tenderness and truth telling. Her work has appeared in
              publications and stages that celebrate cultural memory, resilience, and
              intergenerational wisdom.

              deeply, and transform together.
