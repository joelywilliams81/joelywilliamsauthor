    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Joely Williams, born in the Bronx, is a skilled poet, novelist, storyteller, mother, arts and crafts fanatic, and home baker. Her work drifts through magazines and newspapers based in the boroughs of NYC, while her poetry finds a home in Liminal Women: A Drink From The Wellspring by Abigail Fox Green and Jennifer Goldring. She nearly claimed a bachelor’s degree in creative writing but instead humbly holds an associate’s degree in writing and literature—a reminder that the path to expression is rarely linear. Now residing in Columbia, Joely invites readers to unearth their buried stories through reflection, creative exploration, and the bold, raw, and sometimes defiant power of self-expression.
