        <h1>Custom Poetry for Life&apos;s Sacred Moments</h1>
        <p>
          Poetry can bless a room, hold a memory, and gather people into a shared
          breath. Let&apos;s create words that honor your milestone and the people you
          love.

            <h2>What I offer</h2>
            <p>
              From intimate gatherings to large-scale programs, I craft original
              poems, speeches, and scripts that reflect the intention behind your
              event. Each piece is rooted in attentive listening and collaborative
              storytelling.

            <h3>Discovery call</h3>
            <p>
              We begin with a conversation about your event, the people we&apos;re
              honoring, and the emotional tone you want to set. This can happen by
              phone, video, or a thoughtful questionnaire.

          <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Collaborative drafting</h3>
            <p>
              After gathering your stories, I draft a piece that reflects your voice
              and values. We review together, invite edits, and ensure the language
              feels aligned with your intentions.

            <h3>Delivery & support</h3>
            <p>
              You&apos;ll receive a polished written piece, along with optional
              performance notes and a recorded read-through so you can feel confident
              bringing the words into the room.
